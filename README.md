# Bash-Scripts
A collection of simple file processing scripts. Nothing fancy and can be easily written in any scripting language. I primarily used them during my PhD while working with output files and hope this can be of use for students or people with no prior scritping or programming experience.

New scripts will be added on a rolling basis.

**Target Audience Experience Level:** Beginner

**Operating System:** `Ubuntu/Linux`

**Dependencies:**     `None`

# List of Scripts in this Repository

## RenameAllFilesinADirectory.sh

This script adds a prefix to all files in a directoty with a particular extension. This is useful if you have output files with the same names but from different experiments/iterations. Further usage instructions are available in the script.
